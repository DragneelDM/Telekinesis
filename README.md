## MY Footnote

 John Lemon is a Game. Very nice game......

Lol, With all seriousness. This was a very personal project because of how the development put me through hell for very mediocre reasons. I Learnt Timelines during the development process and this game will have more meaning and depth in
the future when we look back at it and remember.
